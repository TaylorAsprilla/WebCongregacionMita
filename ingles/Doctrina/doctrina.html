    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="mensj">The Mita Congregation is a Christian church, organized in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) in
       the year 1940, whose doctrine is based on the Holy Bible, Reina-Valera version. We are the continuation 
       of the primitive church established by Christ and confirmed by the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1-4). Our foundation
        is the Most Holy Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We firmly believe that the Bible testifies to 
        the work of God. We accept and emphasize the practice of the Biblical precepts established by God in 
        the Old and the New Testament. We believe in the promise of our Lord Jesus Christ, who said that He 
        would send the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, to be with His children forever (John 14:16). By faith, 
        the Mita Congregation believes that the Holly Spirit of God is on earth, that His new name is Mita 
        and that through Rosinín, He directs His work (Revelation 2:17, 3:12).
      <br> <br>
      This Congregation carries out a work of good, love and spiritual improvement. We proclaim a triple message
       of Love, Freedom and Unity, so that everyone who feels the need for God receives the redemptive word,
        making him or her a person transformed by His grace (2 Corinthians 5:17) (Ephesians 2:8-10).
      <br> <br>
      We believe that the first dispensation of the Divine Trinity was that of the Father, where with the name
       of Jehovah, God guided His people through the prophets (Isaiah 42:8). The second dispensation is that
        of God as Son, with the name of Jesus Christ (Matthew 16:13-17). Now, the third dispensation is that 
        of the Holy Spirit, where God with His new name Mita, directs His people through His prophets (1 John 5:7).
         At the beginning of this Congregation, Mita led this church through Juanita García Peraza; then through 
         Teófilo Vargas Seín (Aarón) and now through Rosinín Rodríguez.
      <br> <br>
      The name of Mita —whose meaning is Spirit of Life— is the fulfillment of the Biblical prophecies that 
      indicated that God would reveal a new name for these days (Isaiah 52:6, 62:2. Revelation 2:17 and 3:12).
       When we talk about Mita in our religious services, we are not referring to the human body of Juanita García
        Peraza, but we refer to the Holy Spirit of God manifested in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16).</p>

      <h2><b>The Triple Message</b></h2>
      <p class="mensj">From the beginning of this Work in the year 1940, God invited us to spread a
         triple message: Love, Freedom, and Unity.

        <br>

        <p class="mensj"><b>Love</b> because God is love, and for love He has descended to earth to seek and
           save souls that are plunged into darkness; <b>Freedom</b> because God offers the human being the 
           opportunity to be free from the shackles of sin to feel within themselves the presence of God 
           and <b>Unity</b> because our called is unifying. This was expressed by Christ when He raised 
           to the Father the prayer that the apostle John collects in his gospel, in chapter 17 and verse 21: 
           «That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in 
           us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me»

        and at 6:00 p.m. The Mita members who listen to it, place their right hand on their chest and say a
         prayer to God as a sign of reverence and gratitude.</p>

         17, when he saw in revelation a people dressed in white clothes and was asked: <b>"What are these which 
         are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?</b> These are they which came out of great tribulation,
          and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb"</p>

         she saw a star that detached itself from heaven, collided on her forehead, and filled her with his

      <h2><b>Ministerial Groups</b></h2>
      <p class="mensj"><b>The Mita Congregation</b> has ministerial groups made up of hundreds of <b>preachers,
         evangelists, deaconesses and deacons.</b> This groups are under the direction of <b>Rosinín</b> maximum 
         spiritual leader and prophet of our Congregation. Next to her, a <b>board of directors</b> take the 
         decisions concerning the administrative sphere. The pastors —whom we also call <b>"workers"</b> - 
         are people faithful to the Congregation and its doctrine, of impeccable testimony in the spiritual
          and moral field, and they carry out the tasks inherent to their ministry. Among these tasks are:</p>

      <p class="listas mensj">
        <b>1.</b> Preaching in religious services.
        <br>
        <b>2.</b> Visits to parishioners to learn about their needs and the situations that affect them.
        <br>
        <b>3.</b> Orientation visits to recently converted brothers.
        <br>
        <b>4.</b> Visits to the sick in their homes or in hospitals.
        <br>
        <b>5.</b> Funeral services.
      </p>

      <p class="mensj">The ministerial tasks, in general, follow the postulates of the <b>Early Church</b> established
         by Christ in the Holy Bible. <b>The pastors of the Mita Congregation are not salaried.</b> They preach the gospel
          for free, out of <b>love to souls</b>, in reference to the words of Christ in the gospel according to John 
        <b>chapter 10, verses 11-13:</b> “I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. 
          But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, 
          and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The hireling 
          fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep”.</p>

      <p class="mensj">In addition, in religious services we pray, Biblical texts are read, hymns are sung, and
         doctrinal points are preached. In the preaching, the messages are based on the Holy Bible. At the end 
         of each service, Rosinín, whom we also lovingly call "Mom", brings her exhortation, teachings, her advice,
          her encouraging and invigorating words.</p>

      <h2><b>Doctrinal Profile</b></h2>
      <p class="mensj">Parishioners are observant of God's laws and civil laws. Our most important commandment
         is Love, as established by Jesus Christ (John 13:34). Consideration is encouraged in the parishioner, 
         empathy, humility, cooperation, solidarity, tolerance, sensitivity and all the fruits of the Spirit 
         (Galatians 5:22). We do not enter into political-partisan polemics or with other religions. We do not
          ingest alcoholic beverages cigarettes or drugs. We refrain from gambling, dancing, makeup, jewelry,
           among other things. We are peaceful, honest, and respectful people of ourselves and others. We believe
            that we teach by example, that we have to live what we preach. We believe in the salvation of the
             soul by faith and grace. We believe that the The Holy Spirit is on Earth and has come to do a work 
             of holiness, of transformation in consciousness and in the heart of the human being to change our 
             lives, make us good with ourselves and with our neighbor, and fit for eternal life. We believe that
              Rosinín is a prophet, a spiritual mother chosen at this time, as Deborah was in ancient times.</p>

      <h2><b>Decalogue of the Spirit</b></h2>
      <p class="mensj">We believe that God must be served fully. Juanita García Peraza —by revelation of the 
        Holly Spirit— wrote in 1941 the Decalogue of the Spirit:</p>

      <p class="mensj">The Ministry of the Senses is the one that will now remain standing. Hearing the Holy Spirit;
         knowing and feeling His voice. Using His children's limbs in this ministry. By His Holy Spirit we will 
         walk behind His law, which is the covenant made with His people in these days.

        <br><br>

        The Holy Spirit will do the work in this ministry. That's why:
      </p>

      <p class="listas mensj">
        <b>1.</b> One must submit to the ordinance of the Holy Spirit exclusively, <br>
        so that the servant of God is forced or girded by the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<br>
        <b>2.</b> Give Him your mind and He will reveal what you have to do.<br>
        <b>3.</b> Give Him your mouth and He will do and speak what He wants to express.<br>
        <b>4.</b> Give Him your heart and you will feel and say His law.<br>
        <b>5.</b> Give Him your hands and He will put them where necessary.<br>
        <b>6.</b> Give Him your feet and He will take you where He needs you.<br>
        <b>7.</b> Give Him your ears and you will hear His voice.<br>
        <b>8.</b> Give Him your eyes and you will see the wonders of His law.<br>
        <b>9.</b> Give Him your soul and you won't go to hell.<br>
        <b>10.</b> Give Him your entire body and you will be transformed by His image.<br>
