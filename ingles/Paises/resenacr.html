          The Work of Mita arrived in Costa Rica in 1986. A Costa Rican named Elsa Mora, who lived in Puerto Rico,
          learned
          about the Congregation that year. She communicates with her sister Alicia Mora in Costa Rica and tells her
          about
          the wonderful Work that she had known. Alicia, impressed with what her sister told her, writes a letter to the
          Mita Congregation in Puerto Rico asking them to send workers (pastors) to take this message of salvation to
          Costa Rican lands. On April 6, 1986, the first workers arrived in Costa Rica. They were Amador Laureano and
          Adrián Narváez.
        </p>

        <p class="mensj">
          Alicia had told her brother Evelio Mora to pick up the workers at the airport. Evelio tells her that he was
          going to do her a favor, but that he did not want to know about ministers, churches or religion. He was very
          disillusioned with the religious systems, and this had hardened his heart. To Evelio's surprise, when he saw
          the
          workers at the airport, they turned into angels. He had never seen them, not even through photos, but God
          allowed him to have this vision so that he would recognize them and confirm that they were His envoys. Taking
          them to the house where they were going to stay, he did not want to leave because he wanted to know what
          message
          they were preaching. The workers told him about the powerful Work of the Holy Spirit of God. Evelio accepted
          the
          message and joined the church.
        </p>

        <p class="mensj">
          The first religious services took place in the San Felipe de Alajuelita sector, belonging to the capital San
          José. Services were also held in the Vizcaya area and other sectors. In 1987, Aarón arrived for the first time
          accompanied by a group of brothers from Puerto Rico. That first service is carried out with Aaron present, in
          a
          meeting room of the Balmoral hotel in the city of San José, where dozens of souls were touched by the divine
          message and joined this Work.

          The Work of Mita continued to grow in Costa Rica and in 1994 a temple was inaugurated in the community of San
          Sebastián, San José. Currently, the congregation has a wind band and a string ensemble. On October 4, 2022,
          Rosinín arrives for the first time, as the Spiritual Leader of this Work, to Costa Rican lands, this trip
          being
          a great blessing for our Tico brothers. Currently, hundreds of souls have embraced this faith in this Central
          American republic.

        <div id="LayoutDiv1">
          <h1>TESTIMONIES</h1>
        </div>

        <p class="mensj">
          Among the large number of testimonies that have occurred in Costa Rica, a very surprising one happened in
          1993,
          on the Poás volcano, Alajuela province. The brothers had invited Aarón to discover this natural heritage. Upon
          arriving there, the tourists told the brothers of the Church: «It is very cloudy today; you can't see
          anything."
          The brothers let Aarón know, and he told them: "We are going to see it.". Upon reaching the top from where you
          can see the crater of the volcano, you couldn't really see anything. Faced with this situation, Aarón cried
          out
          with a powerful voice: <b>"Let the clouds be released, let the clouds clear the view so that the brothers can
            see!"</b>. Faced with this clamor, the clouds began to move, and the crater of the volcano began to be seen
          clearly,
          to the point that the lagoon that is above the crater could be seen. Then Aarón exclaimed: <b>"Volcano, we
            came
            from Puerto Rico to see you."</b> Saying that, the volcano began to make a very loud sound like when it was
          going to
          erupt and smoke, and a strong smell of sulfur began to come out. The brothers, fearful, asked Aaron to stop
          that
          effect and he exclaimed:<b>"Stay still!"</b> The noise immediately stopped to the astonishment of all those
          present.
          This experience greatly impressed the brothers from Costa Rica who were present, who confirmed that Aaron was
          a
          prophet of God.
        </p>

        <p class="mensj">
          Another testimony was the one that occurred in 1987 with the little girl Angie Rivera Carit. At 5 years old,
          she
          was playing with her friends in the neighborhood while the brothers from the church began to arrive at her
          home,
          where the service was going to be held that night. At that moment, she fell headfirst into the sidewalk spot.
          All the neighbors were screaming in fear. Being a sector with few resources, no one had a vehicle to
          immediately
          transport the girl to a hospital. They decided to take her to her house and when her mother saw her, she
          realized that she could practically no longer open her eyes because of the amount of blood on her face. The
          brothers who were at home began to assist the girl for fear that she would bleed to death. They began to pray
          to
          Mita, the Holy Spirit of God, to do the work on that girl and stop the bleeding. The worker (pastor) began to
          pray to the girl and asked Mita to stop that bleeding. Miraculously, the bleeding stopped. When they were able
          to get transportation, the girl was taken to the emergency room and had some X-rays done. The doctor was
          surprised to see the results and called the girl and her mother again. He tells them that he needs them to
          explain again how it all happened and what they did to the girl. Again, they explain to the doctor how the
          fall
          was and how everything happened. The doctor says: "It's just that this can't be." The mother, full of faith,
          replies: "It's just that this was Mita." The doctor asks what Mita is, and they explain that it is the new
          name
          of the Holy Spirit of God. The surprised doctor told them: «It definitely has to be God, because that blow
          that
          the girl got, split the superior vena cava in two. That can only be cured with an operation that lasts a long
          time and an expert has to do it. That was a great experience, and the girl was completely healed. Mita, the
          Holy
          Spirit, did the work and instantly healed the girl, Angie. Today, Angie is a healthy adult, a member of the
          Wind
          Band in Costa Rica, and has a beautiful family.
